"Seam provides a convenient method of remotely accessing components from a "
"web page, using AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML). The framework for "
"this functionality is provided with almost no up-front development effort - "
"your components only require simple annotating to become accessible via "
"AJAX. This chapter describes the steps required to build an AJAX-enabled web "
