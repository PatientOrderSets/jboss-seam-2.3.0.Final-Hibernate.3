"For repetitive value bindings such as those found in a JSF dataTable or "
"other iterative control (like <literal>ui:repeat</literal>), the full "
"interceptor stack will be invoked for every invocation of the referenced "
"Seam component. The effect of this can result in a substantial performance "
"hit, especially if the component is accessed many times. A significant "
"performance gain can be achieved by disabling the interceptor stack for the "
"Seam component being invoked. To disable interceptors for the component, add "
"the <literal>@BypassInterceptors</literal> annotation to the component class."

"It is very important to be aware of the implications of disabling "
"interceptors for a Seam component. Features such as bijection, annotated "
"security restrictions, synchronization and others are unavailable for a "
"component marked with <literal>@BypassInterceptors</literal>. While in most "
"cases it is possible to compensate for the loss of these features (e.g. "
"instead of injecting a component using <literal>@In</literal>, you can use "
"<literal>Component.getInstance()</literal> instead) it is important to be "
"aware of the consequences."
