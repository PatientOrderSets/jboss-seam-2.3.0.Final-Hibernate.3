    <title>Configuring Seam and packaging Seam applications</title>
    <para> Configuration is a very boring topic and an extremely tedious pastime. Unfortunately, several lines of XML
        are required to integrate Seam into your JSF implementation and servlet container. There's no need to be too put
        off by the following sections; you'll never need to type any of this stuff yourself, since you can just use 
        seam-gen to start your application or you can copy and paste from the example applications! </para>

    <section>
        <title>Basic Seam configuration</title>

        <para> First, let's look at the basic configuration that is needed whenever we use Seam with JSF. </para>

                contexts. </para>

            <para> Some JSF implementations have a broken implementation of server-side state saving that interferes
                with Seam's conversation propagation. If you have problems with conversation propagation during form
                submissions, try switching to client-side state saving. You'll need this in <literal>web.xml</literal>: </para>

            <para>
                There is a minor gray area in the JSF specification regarding the mutability of view state values. Since
                Seam uses the JSF view state to back its PAGE scope this can become an issue in some cases. If you're
                using server side state saving with the JSF-RI and you want a PAGE scoped bean to keep its exact value
                for a given view of a page you will need to specify the following context-param. Otherwise if a user
                uses the "back" button a PAGE scoped component will have the latest value if it has changed not the
                value of the "back" page. (see
                <ulink url="https://javaserverfaces-spec-public.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=295">
                    Spec Issue
                </ulink>
                ). This setting is not enabled by default because of the performance hit of serializing the JSF view
                with every request.

            <title>Seam servlet filters</title>

            <para> Seam doesn't need any servlet filters for basic operation. However, there are several features which
                depend upon the use of filters. To make things easier, Seam lets you add and configure
                servlet filters just like you would configure other built-in Seam components. To take advantage of this
                feature, we must first install a master filter in <literal>web.xml</literal>: </para>

               The Seam filters share a number of common attributes, you can set these in

                <para> This filter provides the exception mapping functionality in <literal>pages.xml</literal> (almost
                    all applications will need this). It also takes care of rolling back uncommitted transactions when
                    uncaught exceptions occur. (According to the Java EE specification, the web container should do this
                    automatically, but we've found that this behavior cannot be relied upon in all application servers.
                    And it is certainly not required of plain servlet engines like Tomcat.) </para>

                <para> By default, the exception handling filter will process all requests, however this behavior may be

            <title>Integrating Seam with your EJB container</title>

            <para> In a Seam application, EJB components have a certain duality, as they are managed by both the EJB
                container and Seam. Actually, it's more that Seam resolves EJB component references, manages the
                lifetime of stateful session bean components, and also participates in each method call via
                interceptors. Let's start with the configuration of the Seam interceptor chain.</para>

            <para> We need to apply the <literal>SeamInterceptor</literal> to our Seam EJB components. This interceptor
                delegates to a set of built-in server-side interceptors that handle such concerns as bijection,
                conversation demarcation, and business process signals. The simplest way to do this across an entire
                application is to add the following interceptor configuration in <literal>ejb-jar.xml</literal>: </para>

            <para> Seam needs to know where to go to find session beans in JNDI. One way to do this is specify the
                    <literal>@JndiName</literal> annotation on every session bean Seam component. However, this is quite
                tedious. A better approach is to specify a pattern that Seam can use to calculate the JNDI name from the
                EJB name. Fortunately, new portable JNDI Syntax was introduced in Java EE 6. There are three JNDI namespaces for
                portable JNDI lookups - <literal>java:global</literal>, <literal>java:module</literal> and <literal>java:app</literal>.
                More in <ulink url="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gipjf.html#girgn">Java EE 6 tutorial</ulink>
                We usually specify this option in <literal>components.xml</literal>. </para>

            <para> For JBoss AS 7, the following pattern is correct: </para>

            <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<core:init jndi-name="java:app/<ejb-module-name>/#{ejbName}" />]]></programlisting>

            <para> In this case, <literal>&lt;ejb-module-name&gt;</literal> is the name of the EJB module (by default it is filename of ejb jar)
             in which the bean is deployed, Seam replaces <literal>#{ejbName}</literal> with the name of the EJB. </para>

            <para> How these JNDI names are resolved and somehow locate an EJB component might appear a bit like black
                magic at this point, so let's dig into the details. First, let's talk about how the EJB components get
                into JNDI.</para>

            <para> EJB components would get assigned a global JNDI name automatically, using the pattern
                described in <ulink url="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gipjf.html#girgn">Java EE 6 tutorial</ulink>.
                 The EJB name is the first non-empty value from the following list: </para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The value of the <literal>&lt;ejb-name&gt;</literal> element in ejb-jar.xml</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The value of the <literal>name</literal> attribute in the @Stateless or @Stateful annotation</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The simple name of the bean class</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para> Let's look at an example. Assume that you have the following EJB bean and interface defined. </para>

            <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[package com.example.myapp;

import javax.ejb.Local;

@Local
public interface Authenticator
{
    boolean authenticate();
}

package com.example.myapp;

import javax.ejb.Stateless;

@Stateless
@Name("authenticator")
public class AuthenticatorBean implements Authenticator
{ 
    public boolean authenticate() { ... }
}
]]></programlisting>

            <para> Assuming your EJB bean class is deployed in an EAR named myapp, the global JNDI name 
                myapp/AuthenticatorBean/local will be assigned to it on JBoss AS. As you learned, you can reference this
                EJB component as a Seam component with the name <literal>authenticator</literal> and Seam will take care
                of finding it in JNDI according to the JNDI pattern (or <literal>@JndiName</literal> annotation).
                </para>

            <para>So what about the rest of the application servers? Well, according to the Java EE spec, which most
                vendors try to adhere to religiously, you have to declare an EJB reference for your EJB in order for it
                to be assigned a JNDI name. That requires some XML. It also means that it is up to you to establish a
                JNDI naming convention so that you can leverage the Seam JNDI pattern. You might find the JBoss
                convention a good one to follow.</para>

            <para>There are two places you have to define the EJB reference when using Seam on non-JBoss application
                servers. If you are going to be looking up the Seam EJB component through JSF (in a JSF view or as a JSF
                action listener) or a Seam JavaBean component, then you must declare the EJB reference in web.xml. Here
                is the EJB reference for the example component just shown: </para>

            <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<ejb-local-ref>
    <ejb-ref-name>myapp/AuthenticatorBean</ejb-ref-name>
    <ejb-ref-type>Session</ejb-ref-type>
    <local>org.example.vehicles.action.Authenticator</local>
</ejb-local-ref>
]]></programlisting>

            <para>This reference will cover most uses of the component in a Seam application. However, if you want to
                be able to inject a Seam EJB component into another Seam EJB component using <literal>@In</literal>, you
                need to define this EJB reference in another location. This time, it must be defined in ejb-jar.xml, and
                it's a bit tricker. </para>

            <para>Within the context of an EJB method call, you have to deal with a somewhat sheltered JNDI context.
                When Seam attempts to find another Seam EJB component to satisfy an injection point defined using
                <literal>@In</literal>, whether or not it finds it depends on whether an EJB reference exists in
                JNDI. Strictly speaking, you cannot simply resolve JNDI names as you please. You have to define
                the references explicitly. Fortunately, JBoss recognized how aggravating this would be for the
                developer and all versions of JBoss automatically register EJBs so they are always available in
                JNDI, both to the web container and the EJB container. So if you are using JBoss, you can skip the next
                few paragraphs. However, if you are deploying to GlassFish, pay close attention.</para>
                
            <para>For application servers that stubbornly adhere to the EJB specification, EJB references must always be
                defined explicitly. But unlike with the web context, where a single resource reference covers all
                uses of the EJB from the web environment, you cannot declare EJB references globally in the EJB container.
                Instead, you have to specify the JNDI resources for a given EJB component one-by-one.</para>

            <para> Let's assume that we have an EJB named RegisterAction (the name is resolved using the three steps
                mentioned previously). That EJB has the following Seam injection:</para>

            <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@In(create = true)
Authenticator authenticator;
]]></programlisting>

            <para> In order for this injection to work, the link must be established in the ejb-jar.xml file as follows: </para>

            <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<ejb-jar>
    <enterprise-beans>
        <session>
            <ejb-name>RegisterAction</ejb-name>
            <ejb-local-ref>
                <ejb-ref-name>myapp/AuthenticatorAction/local</ejb-ref-name>
                <ejb-ref-type>Session</ejb-ref-type>
                <local>com.example.myapp.Authenticator</local>
            </ejb-local-ref>
        </session>
    </enterprise-beans>

    ...
    
</ejb-jar>
]]></programlisting>

            <para> Notice that the contents of the <literal>&lt;ejb-local-ref&gt;</literal> are identical to what we
                defined in web.xml. What we are doing is bringing the reference into the EJB context where it can be
                used by the RegisterAction bean. You will need to add one of these references for any injection of a
                Seam EJB component into another Seam EJB component using <literal>@In</literal>. (You can see an
                example of this setup in the jee5/booking example).</para>

            <para> But what about <literal>@EJB</literal>? It's true that you can inject one EJB into another using
                <literal>@EJB</literal>. However, by doing so, you are injecting the actual EJB reference rather than the
                Seam EJB component instance. In this case, some Seam features will work, while others won't. That's
                because Seam's interceptor is invoked on any method call to an EJB component. But that only invokes
                Seam's server-side interceptor chain. What you lose is Seam's state management and Seam's client-side
                interceptor chain. Client-side interceptors handle concerns such as security and concurrency. Also, when
                injecting a SFSB, there is no guarantee that you will get the SFSB bound to the active session or
                conversation, whatever the case may be. Thus, you definitely want to inject the Seam EJB component using
                <literal>@In</literal>.</para>
<!-- 
            <para> That covers how JNDI names are defined and used. The lesson is that with some application servers,
                such as GlassFish, you are going to have to specify JNDI names for all EJB components explicitly, and
                sometimes twice! And even if you are following the same naming convention as JBoss AS, the JNDI pattern
                in Seam may need to be altered. For instance, the global JNDI names are automatically prefixed with
                java:comp/env on GlassFish, so you need to define the JNDI pattern as follows:</para>
 
            <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<core:init jndi-name="java:comp/env/earName/#{ejbName}/local" />]]></programlisting>
-->
            <para>
                Finally, let's talk about transactions. In an EJB environment, we recommend the use of a special
                built-in component for transaction management, that is fully aware of container transactions, and can
                correctly process transaction success events registered with the <literal>Events</literal> component. If
                you don't add this line to your <literal>components.xml</literal> file, Seam won't know when
                container-managed transactions end: </para>

        <section>
            <title>Don't forget!</title>

            <para> There is one final item you need to know about. You must place a <literal>seam.properties</literal>,
                    <literal>META-INF/seam.properties</literal> or <literal>META-INF/components.xml</literal> file in
                any archive in which your Seam components are deployed (even an empty properties file will do). At
                startup, Seam will scan any archives with <literal>seam.properties</literal> files for seam components. </para>

            <para> In a web archive (WAR) file, you must place a <literal>seam.properties</literal> file in the
                    <literal>WEB-INF/classes</literal> directory if you have any Seam components included here. </para>

            <para> That's why all the Seam examples have an empty <literal>seam.properties</literal> file. You can't
                just delete this file and expect everything to still work! </para>

            <para> You might think this is silly and what kind of idiot framework designers would make an empty file
                affect the behavior of their software?? Well, this is a workaround for a limitation of the
                JVM &#8212; if we didn't use this mechanism, our next best option would be to force you to list every
                component explicitly in <literal>components.xml</literal>, just like some other competing frameworks do!

        <title>Configuring Seam without EJB</title>

        <para> Seam is useful even if you're not yet ready to take the plunge into EJB 3.1. In this case you would use
            Hibernate 4 instead of EJB 3.1 persistence, and plain JavaBeans instead of session beans. You'll miss
            out on some of the nice features of session beans but it will be very easy to migrate to EJB 3.1 when you're
            ready and, in the meantime, you'll be able to take advantage of Seam's unique declarative state management
            architecture. </para>

        <para> Seam JavaBean components do not provide declarative transaction demarcation like session beans do. You

            <literal>UserTransaction</literal> or declaratively using Seam's <literal>@Transactional</literal>
            annotation. But most applications will just use Seam managed transactions when using Hibernate with
            JavaBeans. </para>

        <para> The Seam distribution includes a version of the booking example application that uses Hibernate and
            JavaBeans instead of EJB, and another version that uses JPA and JavaBeans. These example applications are

        <title>Configuring Seam in Java SE</title>

        <para> It is possible to use Seam completely outside of an EE environment. In this case, you need to tell Seam
            how to manage transactions, since there will be no JTA available. If you're using JPA, you can tell
            Seam to use JPA resource-local transactions, ie. <literal>EntityTransaction</literal>, like so: </para>
            
        <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<transaction:entity-transaction entity-manager="#{entityManager}"/>]]></programlisting>
        
        <para> If you're using Hibernate, you can tell Seam to use the Hibernate transaction API like this: </para>
            
        <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<transaction:hibernate-transaction session="#{session}"/>]]></programlisting>
        
        <para> Of course, you'll also need to define a datasource.</para>
                
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Configuring jBPM in Seam</title>
        <para> Seam's jBPM integration is not installed by default, so you'll need to enable jBPM by installing a
            built-in component. You'll also need to explicitly list your process and pageflow definitions. In
                <literal>components.xml</literal>: </para>

        <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<bpm:jbpm>
    <bpm:pageflow-definitions>
        <value>createDocument.jpdl.xml</value>
        <value>editDocument.jpdl.xml</value>
        <value>approveDocument.jpdl.xml</value>

    <bpm:process-definitions>
        <value>documentLifecycle.jpdl.xml</value>
    </bpm:process-definitions>
</bpm:jbpm>]]></programlisting>

        <para> No further special configuration is needed if you only have pageflows. If you do have business process
            definitions, you need to provide a jBPM configuration, and a Hibernate configuration for jBPM. The Seam DVD
            Store demo includes example <literal>jbpm.cfg.xml</literal> and <literal>hibernate.cfg.xml</literal> files
            that will work with Seam: </para>

        <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<jbpm-configuration>

        <para> The most important thing to notice here is that jBPM transaction control is disabled. Seam or EJB3 should
            control the JTA transactions. </para>

        <section>
            <title>Packaging</title>

            <para> There is not yet any well-defined packaging format for jBPM configuration and process/pageflow
                definition files. In the Seam examples we've decided to simply package all these files into the root of
                the EAR. In future, we will probably design some other standard packaging format. So the EAR looks
                something like this: </para>

            Seam scans all jars containing <literal>/seam.properties</literal>,
            <literal>/META-INF/components.xml</literal> or <literal>/META-INF/seam.properties</literal>
            on startup for resources. For example, all classes annotated with
            <literal>@Name</literal> are registered with Seam as Seam components.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            You may also want Seam to handle custom resources. A common use case
            is to handle a specific annotation and Seam provides specific 
            support for this. First, tell Seam which annotations to handle in
            <literal>/META-INF/seam-deployment.properties</literal>:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[# A colon-separated list of annotation types to handle
org.jboss.seam.deployment.annotationTypes=com.acme.Foo:com.acme.Bar]]></programlisting>
         
        <para>
            Then, during application startup you can get hold of all classes
            annotated with <literal>@Foo</literal>:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Name("fooStartup")
@Scope(APPLICATION)
@Startup
public class FooStartup {

   @In("#{deploymentStrategy.annotatedClasses['com.acme.Foo']}")
   private Set<Class<Object>> fooClasses;
   
   @In("#{hotDeploymentStrategy.annotatedClasses['com.acme.Foo']}")
   private Set<Class<Object>> hotFooClasses;

   @Create
   public void create() {
      for (Class clazz: fooClasses) {
         handleClass(clazz);
      }
      for (Class clazz: hotFooClasses) {
         handleClass(clazz);
      }
   }
   
   public void handleClass(Class clazz) {
       // ...
   }

}]]></programlisting>

        <para>    
            You can also handle <emphasis>any</emphasis> resource. For example, 
            you process any files with the extension <literal>.foo.xml</literal>.
            To do this, we need to write a custom deployment handler:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public class FooDeploymentHandler implements DeploymentHandler {
    private static DeploymentMetadata FOO_METADATA = new DeploymentMetadata()
    {

        public String getFileNameSuffix() {
            return ".foo.xml";
        }
    };
    
   public String getName() {
      return "fooDeploymentHandler";
   }

    public DeploymentMetadata getMetadata() {
        return FOO_METADATA;
    }
}]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Here we are just building a list of any files with the suffix 
            <literal>.foo.xml</literal>. 
        </para>
        
        <para>
            Then, we need to register the deployment handler with Seam in
            <literal>/META-INF/seam-deployment.properties</literal>.  
            You can register multiple deployment handler using a comma 
            separated list.
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[# For standard deployment
org.jboss.seam.deployment.deploymentHandlers=com.acme.FooDeploymentHandler
# For hot deployment

         <para>
             Seam uses deployment handlers internally to install components and
             namespaces. You can easily access the deployment handler during an 
             <literal>APPLICATION</literal> scoped component's startup:
