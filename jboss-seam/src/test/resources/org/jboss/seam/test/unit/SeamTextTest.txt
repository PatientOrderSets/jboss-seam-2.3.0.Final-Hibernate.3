+Seam Text!
This page demonstrates Seam Text.

++Some examples:

Here is some wiki text: 
*bold* |mono| ~deleted~ _underline_ /italic/ ^super^

This is a new paragraph. (Just leave a blank line.)

*/_Multiple ~tags~ styles_ can be nested!/*

Special characters can be escaped: \| \* \_ 

This is especially useful for HTML: \<notatag\> \&notanentity;

But if we don't want to use escapes in our preformatted
text, we can wrap it in backwards quotes, and special 
characters get escaped automagically:

`//This is some code:

<some-tag/>
"a string" 
a_variable_name 
a||b 
x=y*z/2`

We wrap quoted text in double quotes:

"This is a block quote with /formatting/. The quote can cross multiple 
lines, but a blank line does not start a new paragraph. If you
need multiple paragraphs in a quote, you have to use \<p\>."

You can even have "a quote", or `some code` inside
a regular paragraph!

We use ordinary old HTML for tables: 

<table>
   <tr><td>foo</td><td>*bar*</td><td>baz</td></tr><tr>
   <td>fee</td>
   <td>fi</td>
   <td>/fo/</td>
   </tr>
</table>

And we can use HTML for lists: 

<ol>
   <li>foo</li>
   <li>*bar*</li>
   <li>/baz/</li>
</ol>

<ul><li>foo</li><li>*bar*</li><li>/baz/</li></ul>

But if the items fit on a line, we can use \#
for ordered lists:

# item 1
# item 2
# item 3

And \= for unordered lists:

= item 1
= item 2
= item 3

We use HTML for <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">links</a>.

Or we can use [a special syntax=>http://jboss.org/schema/seam] to
link to [=>http://jboss.org/schema/seam].

And for images: <img src="http://www.hibernate.org/tpl/jboss/img/01_oben_logo.gif"/>

And even for more exotic formatting, for example:

<q>This is a /HTML/ quote with a <a href="http://jboss.org/">link</a>, 
and a "nested quote" and even `some code` in it.</q>

<p>
This is a HTML paragraph with some lists:

# item 1
# item 2

= an item
= another item

And "a quote" in it.
</p>

Oh, and one last thing:

"This is a block quote with

= a list,
= with 2 items

and <i>some HTML</i> formatting and `some code` and
and <a href="http://jboss.org/schema/seam"><i>yet 
another</i> link</a>."
